- Health check endpoint responding correctly
- URL routing working properly
- Static file serving configured

#### ✅ Database (PostgreSQL)
- Database connection established
- All models functioning correctly
- Sample data populated:
  - 33 regions
  - 3 farmer profiles
  - 1+ alerts
  - 8+ risk assessments
- Query performance: ~0.019s for 33 regions

#### ✅ Cache System (Redis)
- Redis connection working
- Cache set/get operations successful
- Used for session storage and Celery message broker

### 2. API Testing

#### ✅ REST API Endpoints
- API root accessible at `/api/v1/`
- Authentication required (Token-based)
- Test user created with token: `edd32be2512b3925348b8529f43ae591edeac7fa`
- All major endpoints responding:
  - `/api/v1/regions/`
  - `/api/v1/risk-assessments/`
  - `/api/v1/alerts/`
  - `/api/v1/weather/`
  - `/api/v1/farmer-profiles/`

### 3. URL Routing Tests

| Endpoint | Status | Behavior |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/` | 302 | Redirects to `/dashboard/` |
| `/admin/` | 302 | Redirects to login |
| `/dashboard/` | 302 | Redirects to login |
| `/reports/` | 302 | Redirects to login |
| `/ussd/` | Working | USSD callback endpoint |
| `/health/` | 200 | Returns "healthy" |
| `/health/detailed/` | 200 | Returns JSON health status |
| `/api/v1/` | 401 | Requires authentication |

### 4. Background Task System

- CSRF protection enabled
- Secure headers configured
- Development warnings noted (expected)

### 6. Data Integration

#### ✅ Model Relationships
- Region-based data organization
- Farmer profile management
- Alert subscription system
- Risk assessment tracking

#### ✅ Data Flow
- Weather data → Risk calculations
- Risk assessments → Alert triggers
- Alerts → Notification delivery
- User registration → Profile creation
